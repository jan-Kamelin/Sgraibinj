            <h1>About</h1>
            <p>Pig Latin has been around for centuries. All members of LACE are proficient in it. Pig Latin is probably the most used language of LACE (besides English).</p>
            <h1>Learn</h1>
            <p>Pig Latin's rules are very simple. If a word starts with a consonant or multiple consonants, move the consonant(s) to the end of the word and add "ay". If a word starts with a vowel, simply add "yay" to the end. If the word has multiple syllables, you can use the above rules for each syllable, but you can also "Pig Latinize" the whole word or divide it up.</p>
            <p>Please keep in mind that this is how members of LACE use Pig Latin, but there are also some other variations.</p>
